  introduction:
    "I worked at a startup for two years, taking the lead on various tasks across front-end, back-end, app development, automation, and machine learning. Afterwards, I worked in an AI research lab where I developed data collection tools and wrote a paper on UX. Since I have often worked in environments with a shortage of developers, I always prioritize productivity and ease of maintenance. I aim to enhance productivity by creating monorepos and libraries, and I strive to write code that is easy for others to understand by using atomic patterns and Storybook.",
